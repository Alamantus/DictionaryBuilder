          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Advertisements are shown in-line with dictionary entries as plain text with a link to your advertised
            content.
            You get up to 50 characters for your headline, up to 200 characters for your body text, and 20 characters
            for the
            text in a button that links wherever you would like it to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Lexiconga, we only want to display advertisements that will appeal to our users, so we work directly with
            our
            advertisers to maintain a manually curated selection of ads. As an advertiser, you will be creating a
            professional
            relationship with Lexiconga to ensure that your advertisements are up to par with what we want our users to
            see.
            All this means is that as long as your advertisement is relevant and your product is not predatory, you're
            good to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Relevant" advertisements include but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Books and Authors</li>
            <li>Conlanging tools</li>
            <li>Writing resoruces</li>
            <li>Video and tabletop games</li>
            <li>Blogs and vlogs</li>
            <li>Cool and interesting products</li>
            <li>Kickstarters related to the above</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We want to help you get the word out about your project or product to Lexiconga users in a way that doesn't
            interfere with their work while also allowing them to find your cool, interesting, and helpful things.
          </p>

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>
            As with the advertisements themselves, the pricing structure is fairly simple, too:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Monthly:</strong> $5.00 per ad
              <ul>
                <li>With Priority: $20.00 per ad</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Yearly:</strong> $50.00 per ad
              <ul>
                <li>With Priority: $200.00 per ad</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What's Priority?</h3>
          <p>
            All current advertisements are shuffled and then displayed to Lexiconga users once every 10 words. If you
            rent your ad space with Priority, then your ads will be shuffled among any other Priority ads and shown
            <em>before</em> any other ads that were not rented with priority.
          </p>

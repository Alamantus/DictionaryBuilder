        <p style="font-size:12px;">This process imports words in a CSV format to the currently loaded dictionary. <small>(Note: You can save an Excel file as a CSV)</small></p>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">The CSV file must have a header line in this order: word,pronunciation,part of speech,equivalent,explanation. Your word data must be in the appropriate order according to the headers. You can use <span class="clickable inline-button" onclick="download('import_template.csv','word,pronunciation,part of speech,equivalent,explanation\n');">this CSV file as a template</span> if you need help.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">Make sure the parts of speech for each word correspond to your dictionary's parts of speech or else you won't be able to find it using a filter. If a part of speech is left blank, you can find the blanks using the "Blank" option in the Filter so you can clean up.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">At a minimum, all of your words <em>must</em> have the "word" field <em>and</em> either the "equivalent" or "explanation" field filled out in the CSV file.</p>

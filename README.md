# DictionaryBuilder
A tool to build simple dictionaries using JSON.

It should be pretty self explanatory when you open the index.html file. Just use the form on the left side of the screen to add/edit words.

You can re-name the current dictionary from the Settings screen.

This line is to test Visual Studio Code's git functionality.
